# devConnector Project
DevConnectors - Course Project:  
Its a small social network called DevConectors ,  
users can register (with a pretty extensive profile)  
with many fields (education, job experiences, ...)  
enter your github username & will interact with the github API to pull the 5 latest repo on github  
forum posts (create posts, comment them, like or unlike them…)  

## Technologies used:
- VSCode editor
- ES6 + Syntaxe
- Async / Await
- React Hooks
- Redux With DevTools
- JWT (Json Web Token)
- Postman HTTP Client
- Mongoose / MongoDB / Atlas
- Bcrypt Password Hashing
- Heroku & Git deployment

## Project in two parts: 
the first half will be building the back and the API, will be using postmen to hit the end points.We’ll be interacting with the database using Mangoose and just dealing with node and express

the second half will be creating the UI (user’s interface) using react using redux for state management.

### 
To be honest the second part of this project was to difficult for me. I feel more comfortable with node then react or reduxe. This course allowed me to better understand node architecture.
