enter your github username & will interact with the github API to pull the 5 latest repo on github  
forum posts (create posts, comment them, like or unlike them…)  

## When
3 weeks (21 days)

## Where
Do it as part of my training programm in Becode's premises

## Technologies used:


- React Hooks X
- Redux With DevTools X
- nodejs
- Postman HTTP Client V
- Mongoose / MongoDB / Atlas V
- Heroku & Git deployment V

## Planning

### Project in two parts: 
- the first half I've build the back and the API, I used postmen to hit the end points.I interact with the database using Mangoose and just dealing with node and express

- the second half i created the UI (user’s interface) using react using redux for state management.

### What I've learned
I feel more comfortable with node then react or reduxe. This course allowed me to better understand node architecture.
